 // Mini Challenge: Counter Component

Create a new React project: new file and new folder

Use bootstrap and install bootstrap

Create a simple React component called Counter that displays a number and two buttons - one for incrementing the number and one for decrementing it. The initial number should be 0.

Requirements:

The component should display the current number.
There should be a button labeled "+" that, when clicked, increments the number by 1.
There should be a button labeled "-" that, when clicked, decrements the number by 1. The number should not go below 0.
Add a reset button that resets the counter to 0.
Style the component to make it visually appealing.

// Comments: Make sure to add code that will prevent the counter from going below zero. other than that everything looks good.
